We are in the process of building more on-demand blocks for Gutenberg!

Check out free [Getwid Base theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/getwid-base/) designed for full compatibility with Getwid plugin.

With Getwid blocks library, we take a special approach to building and styling content in Gutenberg:

* Extensive attributes (configuration settings) for each block to help you create a unique presentation for each content element.
* Real-time customization - click buttons and watch the instant changes.
* Works great with any WordPress theme: unlike many other block plugins, Getwid doesn't override default theme styles - it allows you to add content blocks that maximum inherit styles from your WordPress theme.
* Attention to details in block design: many Getwid blocks contain several pre-made snap and slick styles to help you build a good-looking content and keep it so sitewide.
* We handle seamless interplay with the core Gutenberg WordPress blocks: leverage useful core blocks by employing them together with Getwid blocks.
* Performance-oriented plugin: easy-to-manipulate, lightweight blocks that won't bloat your website.
* We empower you to handle better visual parity with your theme by enabling you to add custom CSS for many Getwid blocks.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin work with any WordPress theme? =

Your theme is rather a container and styling mechanism for blocks. We made sure Getwid blocks maximum inherit default styles from your theme - unless you add your own styles! Getwid is also tested with the Twenty Nineteen theme - they are a great couple.

= What happens to my Getwid content if I deactivate the plugin? =

Your content will be displayed in a simplified format; it'll get back to the initial look after you reactivate Getwid.

= Are Getwid blocks translation-ready? =

Yes. The plugin works with major translation plugins.

= Can I use my own icons? =

Yes. By default Getwid uses Font Awesome icons but you can add your own ones.

= Can I change the "Recent Posts" block layout? =

Yes. Copy this file: `\getwid\includes\templates\recent-posts\post.php` to `{your_theme}\getwid\recent-posts\`.
